## 📖 Abstract
We present an innovative dust collector design inspired by seashell and honeycomb structures. The collector passively traps particulate matter (PM) generated during braking, reducing air pollution and improving sustainability. The design integrates seamlessly with existing brake systems and uses recyclable materials such as aluminum and glass wool.

## 🚗 Motivation
Brake pad wear contributes significantly to PM2.5 and PM10 emissions, impacting human health and the environment. Our design leverages **bionics and biomimicry** to provide a passive, eco‑friendly solution without external power requirements.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- CAD modeling with **Siemens NX**
- Material selection: **Aluminum 6061** and **Glass Wool Honeycomb**
- Cost estimation: ~€140 per unit
- Recycling pathways for aluminum and glass wool
